    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A turkey carcass is what's left after you finish a whole turkey. Instead of throwing the carcass away, some
        people like to use every bit of the bird by making stock or soup. The bones and remaining scraps of meat add
        rich flavor to the broth, ensuring you get every bit of deliciousness out of your holiday dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Place the turkey carcass in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and
        continue cooking until the remaining meat falls off the bone. Remove and chop the meat and discard the
        bones. Strain the broth into a clean soup pot.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add the chopped turkey to the strained broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and add the remaining
        ingredients (tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, onion, celery, cabbage, barley, Worcestershire sauce, salt,
        parsley, basil, bay leaf, pepper, paprika, poultry seasoning, and thyme). Cook until the vegetables are
        tender.
